    <string name="bio_text">"Hi, my name is Ahmed.
        \nI love fish.
        \nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
        \nFun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
        \nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
        \nAnd sometimes I even go fishing.
        \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
        \nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
        \nI'll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
        \nYou should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n\n</string>
